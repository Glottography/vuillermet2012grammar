## Description


This dataset provides non-overlapping, contemporary, approximate ranges for indigenous languages of Amazonia based on maps 8, 9 and 11 in Vuillermet 2012.

### Coverage

```geojson
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-69.6, -22.6], [-69.6, -9.9], [-58.3, -9.9], [-58.3, -22.6], [-69.6, -22.6]]]}, "properties": {}}
```


### Glottocode assignment

The source map sometimes provides multiple language labels for the same polygon. This is handled
in this dataset by assigning the polygon to **all** languages appearing as label - even though the
distribution of labels seems to suggest that only (unspecific) parts of the polygon are concerned.
